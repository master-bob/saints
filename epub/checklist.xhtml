<h1>5. Checklist for Saints and Psychopaths</h1>
<div class="section" id="psychopaths">
<h2>5.1. Psychopaths</h2>
<p>When confronted with wrong-doing, psychopaths will typically respond in this sequence:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ignore the issue</p></li>
<li><p>Deny that they have done something wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Attack the accuser, usually accusing the accuser of being the one who has done wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Threaten to harm the accuser, someone else, something, or self</p></li>
<li><p>Apologize and admit that they have done wrong, and ask for a clean slate or new start</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Psychopaths will resist completing this five step sequence of responses, and will complete it only if confrontation persists.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saints">
<h2>5.2. Saints</h2>
<p>When confronted with wrong-doing, saints will typically respond in this sequence:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Acknowledge errors and misunderstandings</p></li>
<li><p>Admit that they have made an error</p></li>
<li><p>Apologize</p></li>
<li><p>Offer compensation or correction</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid that type of error or misunderstanding in the future</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Saints are inclined to complete this five step sequence without continued confrontation.</p>
<p>Allow for personality characteristics and cultural factors when evaluating responses to wrong-doing.</p>
